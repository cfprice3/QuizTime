For this project we were to create a quiz based on javascript knowledge.  It was to be responsive, and primarily using vanilla javascript to create the interactivity.  

You were to be asked questions with a timer, and if you answered incorrectly it would deduct additional time.

At the end of the quiz, you were prompted to add your initials to be added to your score which would be recorded into local storage.

My biggest problem is trying to record the scores and initials into local storage.
